## Prerequisites

- [.NET 10 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)

---

## Getting Started

```powershell
# Clone the repository
git clone <repo-url>
cd pitsea-rc-results-processing

# Run the web app
dotnet run --project .\RaceResults.Web\RaceResults.Web.csproj
```

Open the URL printed to the console (typically `http://localhost:5200` when using the default launch profile).

The SQLite database (`raceresults.db`) is created automatically on first run in the working directory.

### Logo assets

The shared layout expects the following logo files:

- `RaceResults.Web/wwwroot/images/pitsea-logo-white.png`
- `RaceResults.Web/wwwroot/images/pitsea-logo-black.png`

If these files are missing, the navbar logo will not render.

## Data Persistence

Data is stored in a **SQLite database** (`raceresults.db`) in the application working directory. The schema is created and migrated automatically at startup.

To use a custom database path, add a connection string to `appsettings.json`:

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Data Source=C:\\Data\\myrace.db"
  }
}
```

**Data reset rules:**
- Uploading new entrants automatically clears all finish bib and timing data to maintain consistency
- Uploading a new finish bib file automatically clears timing data

---

## Upload File Formats

### Entrant files (`.xlsx`)

| Column | Required | Accepted header names |
|---|---|---|
| Bib number | ✅ | `Bib`, `BibNumber`, `BibNo`, `Bib Num`, `Number`, `Race Number`, `Race No`, `Runner Number` |
| Name | ✅ | `Name`, `FullName`, `RunnerName` |
| Gender | ✅ | `Gender`, `Sex`, `M/F` |
| Age | ❌ | `Age` |
| Club | ❌ | `Club`, `Team`, `Club Name` |

- Multiple files can be uploaded at once (e.g. online pre-registration + on-the-day sign-ups)
- Duplicate bib numbers across files are rejected
- Gender values are normalised: anything starting with `M` → `Male`, `F` → `Female`

### Finish bib file (`.xlsx`)

| Column | Required | Accepted header names |
|---|---|---|
| Position | ✅ | `Position`, `FinishPosition`, `Place` |
| Bib | ✅ | `Bib`, `BibNumber`, `BibNo`, `Bib Num`, `Number`, `Race Number`, `Race No`, `Runner Number` |

### Timing file (`.csv` or `.xlsx`)

**CSV format** (e.g. from a virtual volunteer timing device):
```
STARTOFEVENT,03/04/2026 11:18:54,device-info
1,03/04/2026 11:19:20,00:17:51
2,03/04/2026 11:19:33,00:18:04
...
ENDOFEVENT,...
```
- The `STARTOFEVENT` / `ENDOFEVENT` rows are ignored automatically
- Zero-based position numbering is detected and remapped to 1-based

**XLSX format:**

| Column | Required | Accepted header names |
|---|---|---|
| Position | ✅ | `Position`, `FinishPosition`, `Place` |
| Time | ✅ | `Time`, `Timing`, `FinishTime` |

---

## Workflow

The typical sequence for processing results after a race:

```
1. Uploads page    →  Upload entrant files (.xlsx)
2. Uploads page    →  Upload finish bib file (.xlsx)
3. Uploads page    →  Upload timing file (.csv or .xlsx)
4. Results page    →  Review collated results and DNF list
5. Results page    →  Edit any incorrect rows if needed
6. Stats page      →  View numeric stats and chart breakdowns (gender, category, club, finishers/minute)
7. Top 10 page     →  View category leaders
8. Results page    →  Export PDF
```

All pages show a live count of loaded entrants, finish rows, and timing rows at the top so you can see the current data state at a glance.

All operational race data is scoped to the current selected event.

### Champions of Champions (Yearly Cumulative)

For Crown to Crown races (May-September season), points are automatically calculated and accumulated:

```
1. After each event's results are complete (uploads + timings)
   → Points awarded to top 10 per category (10→1 scale)
2. Points audit trail automatically tracks all scoring actions
3. Champions leaderboard accessible anytime at /Champions/Leaderboard
   → View current year or past years via year selector
   → Tied runners marked with † and ranked by event participation
4. Edit any past result
   → Entire season points automatically recalculated
   → Audit log updated with "Recalculated" entry
5. PDF export available
   → Current year or any past year
   → Includes tie-breaking indicators and top 3 highlighting
```

**Points Allocation:**
- 1st place: 10 points
- 2nd place: 9 points
- ...
- 10th place: 1 point
- 11th+ place: 0 points

**Tie-Breaking:**
When runners have equal cumulative points, they are ranked by number of events completed (more events = higher rank). Tied runners are visually indicated with † on the leaderboard.

---

## Champions of Champions

The Champions of Champions is a **yearly cumulative leaderboard** that ranks runners across all Crown to Crown races from May through September. It recognizes consistent top performers throughout the season.

### How It Works

**Automatic Scoring:**
- After each Crown to Crown race is fully uploaded (entrants + finish positions + timings), the top 10 finishers in each category automatically receive points
- Points are allocated on a 10→1 scale (1st place = 10 points, 2nd = 9, ..., 10th = 1; 11th+ = 0 points)
- Categories: Male (18+), Female (18+), Male U18, Female U18
- All scores are tracked with a complete audit trail

**Leaderboard Display:**
- Accessible at `/Champions/Leaderboard`
- Shows cumulative scores across all events in the season
- **Year Selector:** Dropdown to view past or current season leaderboards (2024 onwards)
- **Ranking:** Runners ranked by total points, with ties broken by number of events completed (more events = higher rank)
- **Tie Indicator:** Runners with equal points are marked with † (dagger symbol) with a key explaining the tie-breaking rule
- **Top 3 Highlighting:**
  - 1st place: Gold background
  - 2nd place: Silver background
  - 3rd place: Bronze background

**Edit Handling:**
- If any past race result is edited (position, runner category, etc.), the entire season's points are **automatically recalculated**
- All scoring changes are logged with timestamps and reasons in the audit trail
- Maintains data integrity and accuracy

**Data Isolation:**
- Each season year is completely isolated (2024 season, 2025 season, etc.)
- No cross-year contamination
- Supports multi-year historical data

**PDF Export:**
- `/Champions/ExportPdf` generates a branded PDF of the leaderboard
- Can export any season year via `?year=2025` parameter
- Includes:
  - Event date and season year
  - All categories with runners ranked
  - Tie-breaking indicators and colors
  - Top 3 highlighting with background colors
  - Run number column showing event participation count

### Database Schema

**ChampionOfChampionsScore Table:**
- Stores cumulative seasonal scores per runner per category
- Indexed by (SeasonYear, EntrantId, Category) for fast lookups
- Tracks: TotalPoints, RaceCount (number of events participated), LastUpdated timestamp

**PointsAuditLog Table:**
- Complete audit trail of all scoring actions
- Tracks: EventId, EntrantId, Category, PointsAwarded, Action (Initial/Recalculated/Voided), Reason
- Enables recalculation: all points can be recalculated from audit logs
- Provides transparency and compliance tracking

### Service Layer

**IChampionsOfChampionsService Interface:**
- `CalculateAndSaveEventPointsAsync(eventId)` - Scores top 10 per category for an event
- `RecalculateSeasonPointsAsync(seasonYear)` - Recalculates entire season (called on result edits)
- `GetLeaderboardAsync(seasonYear, asOfEventId?)` - Retrieves cumulative leaderboard
- `GetCurrentSeasonLeaderboardAsync(asOfEventId?)` - Retrieves current year leaderboard
- `IsEligibleForPointsAsync(entrantId, eventId, category)` - Checks if runner scored

**Integration Points:**
- Triggered after all race data (timings) uploaded for a Crown to Crown event
- Triggered when any result in a season is edited
- Service automatically extracts season year from event date

### URL Routes

```
GET  /Champions/Leaderboard                    → Current year leaderboard
GET  /Champions/Leaderboard?year=2025          → 2025 season leaderboard
GET  /Champions/Leaderboard?year=2025&eventId=5 → 2025 leaderboard as of event 5
GET  /Champions/ExportPdf                      → Export current year to PDF
GET  /Champions/ExportPdf?year=2025            → Export 2025 season to PDF
GET  /Champions/ExportPdf?year=2025&eventId=5  → Export 2025 as of event 5
```

### UI Components

**Year Selector:**
- Dropdown menu showing available years (2024 to current year)
- Defaults to current year
- Clicking a year navigates to `/Champions/Leaderboard?year=YYYY`

**Leaderboard Table:**
- Grouped by category (Male, Female, Male U18, Female U18)
- Columns: Rank | Name | Club | Events | Points
- Runners with tied points marked with † in rank column
- Mobile-responsive design

**Tie-Breaking Key:**
- Blue info banner explaining: "When runners have equal points, they are ranked by number of races completed (more events = higher rank)"
- Visual indicator † next to rank for tied runners

**PDF Styling:**
- Same tie-breaking indicators and colors as web view
- Professional branded layout
- Suitable for printing and distribution

### Test Coverage

- **7 comprehensive unit tests** covering:
  - Point calculation accuracy (top 10 allocation)
  - Cumulative scoring across events
  - Category differentiation
  - Audit log tracking
  - Tie-breaking logic
  - Visual highlighting for top 3
  - Tie detection and marking

---

## Configuration

Key settings in `appsettings.json`:

```json
{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft.AspNetCore": "Warning"
    }
  },
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Data Source=raceresults.db"
  }
}
```

Logging writes to the console by default. Validation failures are logged as `Warning`; unhandled exceptions are logged as `Error` with request path and method.

---

## PDF Layout

The generated PDF follows the race-day format used by Pitsea Running Club:

- Header on all pages: left and right `pitsea-logo-white.png` logos, `PITSEA RUNNING CLUB`, and current event title in the format `[Event Name] RESULTS [Event Date]`
- Event date in PDF title uses ordinal day + uppercase month/year (for example: `3RD APRIL 2026`)
- Page 1: winners summary (`1st Male`, `1st Female`, `1st Male Youth`, `1st Female Youth`) plus course records line
- All pages: results table with columns `Position`, `Time`, `Race No`, `Name`, `Gender`, `Club Name`
- Table styling: black header row with white text and white borders; plain white body rows
- Column alignment in PDF table: `Position`, `Time`, `Race No`, and `Gender` are centered
- Continuation pages: same branded header and table styling as page 1, without repeating the winners block
